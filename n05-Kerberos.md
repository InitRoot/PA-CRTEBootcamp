## About Kerberos

Kerberos is the basic of authentication in a Windows AD enviroment. 

<br/>

Clients (programs on behalf of a user) need to obtains tickets from **Key Distribution Center (KDC)**, which is a service running on the domain controller. These tickets represent the client's credential!

<br/>

Therefore, Kerberos is understandably a very interesting target of abuse.
